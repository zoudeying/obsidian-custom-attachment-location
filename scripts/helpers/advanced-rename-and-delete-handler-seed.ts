/**
 * @file
 *
 * Seeds Advanced Rename and Delete Handler into an integration vault, because this plugin declares it as a
 * dependency and loads nothing of its own until it is there.
 *
 * Without it every suite would meet this plugin blocked — no commands, no patches, no settings — and fail on
 * something that has nothing to do with what it tests. So every project that opens a vault seeds it: the plain
 * desktop and Android projects through `scripts/vitest-global-setup.ts`, and the demo-vault and performance
 * projects through their own setups.
 *
 * The seeded copy is the RELEASED build, pinned, for the reason `download-released-plugin.ts` gives: it is
 * what a user installs, and a test that follows a moving artifact stops being a statement about anything.
 *
 * Its settings are seeded too, so that it does nothing a suite did not ask for. Renames, attachment-folder
 * moves and deletions stay off, which is what the vault looked like to this plugin's suites before the
 * dependency existed. The values this plugin reads back — what to do with an emptied folder, which extensions
 * are attachments, which notes win a tie — are this plugin's own historic defaults, the ones it used while the
 * other plugin was absent, so a suite written against those keeps meaning what it meant.
