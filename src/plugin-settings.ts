 * note is gone — removed by a sync client rather than by Obsidian, say — is never visited and its files sit
 * there forever. This mode adds a second, attachment-driven pass for exactly that case.
 *
 * The scope has to be NAMED rather than derived. `attachmentFolderPath` is a per-note template and cannot be
 * run backwards — `${prompt}` and `${random}` throw away the very value the folder name was built from, and
 * two notes can resolve to one folder — so there is no vault-wide attachment root to enumerate. See the file
 * comment of `note-owner-resolver.ts`, which settles the same point for the other direction.
 *
 * {@link None} is the default, because the two list modes delete files no note points at, which is a file
 * the user may be keeping deliberately.
