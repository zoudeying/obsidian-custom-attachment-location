/*
 * The acceptance run for issue #70, with BOTH real plugins on one live vault.
 *
 * <https://github.com/mnaoumov/obsidian-custom-attachment-location/issues/70>: two folders, each holding a
 * note, both referencing one attachment that lives in an attachment unit folder. Deleting one folder rescued
 * the lone linked file and left the rest of the unit behind, so the surviving note inherited a torn tree.
 *
 * The fix spans two plugins: this one publishes the unit-folder designation on the patched
 * `Vault.getAvailablePathForAttachments`, and Advanced Rename and Delete Handler — which owns delete
 * interception since 12.0.0 — reads it back and moves the whole folder.
 *
 * Neither repo could prove that on its own, and both said so. The handler's own suite stages the designation
 * with a stub "without installing the plugin that publishes it"; this repo's
 * `attachment-unit-folder-designation.desktop.integration.test.ts` drives the publish side with no consumer
 * at all. So each side has only ever run against an assumption about the other, which is precisely the seam
 * the reporter stood on.
 *
 * This suite removes the assumption from both ends: the handler's RELEASED build is in the vault and enabled,
 * this plugin publishes the designation from its own settings, and the deletion is the real one. A released
 * artifact rather than a local build, deliberately — it is what a user installs, it pins to a version this file
 * can name, and it needs no checkout of the other repo.
 *
 * The handler is not installed here any more: this plugin declares it as a dependency and cannot load without
 * it, so the global setup seeds it into every vault (`scripts/helpers/advanced-rename-and-delete-handler-seed.ts`).
 * This suite turns on the handler settings it needs and hands them back afterwards, because the handler
 * outlives the file.
 *
 * Desktop-only for the same reason as every other suite here: this is where the vault runs.

 * The pin is also what makes this suite falsifiable. Pointed at 1.2.0 — the last release before the rescue,
 * which still tears the unit apart — it reproduces issue #70 instead of passing, leaving `a/A.md` and
 * `a/assets/image.png`: the linked file pulled OUT of its unit folder and dropped beside it, and the
 * unreferenced sibling destroyed with the deleted folder. That run is how the harness was shown to detect the
 * defect at all rather than to pass vacuously. Since the seed carries the pin for every suite, repeating it
 * means pointing the seed at 1.2.0 for one run — which still satisfies the dependency, because 1.2.0 already
 * publishes contract 1.1.0.
