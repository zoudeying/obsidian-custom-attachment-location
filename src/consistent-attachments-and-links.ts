 * Everything this plugin knows about Consistent Attachments and Links, which still ships its own copy of
 * the attachment-collecting commands this plugin owns.
 *
 * Both plugins register `collect-attachments-entire-vault`, `collect-attachments-in-current-folder`,
 * `collect-attachments-in-file` and `move-attachment-to-proper-folder`, under the same English names.
 * Obsidian namespaces command ids per plugin, so nothing fails to register — the user simply sees each
 * command twice, with nothing but the plugin name to tell the copies apart, and running either one does
 * the work twice.
 *
 * That is annoying rather than destructive, so this is declared as a WARNING and both plugins keep
 * running. Refusing to load over a duplicated palette entry would cost the user far more than the
 * duplicate does.
