/*
 * The overlap guard driven end to end: with a plugin installed that still ships its own copy of this
 * plugin's attachment collecting commands, this one says so and BOTH keep running.
 *
 * That is the whole distinction being tested. A rename/delete overlap corrupts a vault and is answered by
 * refusing to load; a duplicated command merely doubles a palette entry, so refusing would cost the user
 * more than the overlap does. The observable difference is that this plugin is still loaded afterwards.
 *
 * A stub is installed under the overlapping plugin's id at a version that still collects, and this plugin
 * is then reloaded so its load-time read of the manifests runs with the stub present. The intermediate
 * state is reported rather than awaited, so a setup that did not take (the stub never registering, say)
 * fails as a readable expectation instead of an opaque timeout.
 *
 * Cross-platform: an overlapping plugin is just as installable on a phone, and the manifest declares
 * `isDesktopOnly: false`.
