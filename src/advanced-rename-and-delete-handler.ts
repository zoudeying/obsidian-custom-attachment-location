 * Three things need it, so it is written once: the suggestion banner that offers to install it, the
 * migration that hands this plugin's old rename/delete values over to it, and the read-back that asks it for
 * the values this plugin's own features still depend on.
 *
 * The API is DECLARED here rather than imported. That plugin is an Obsidian plugin repo, not an npm package,
 * so there is nothing to depend on — the shape below is this plugin's compiled-against copy of the contract,
 * and `watchPluginApi` negotiates the version at runtime.

 * Advanced Rename and Delete Handler's public API, as this plugin compiles against it.

 * It publishes contract version `1.1.0`, so consumers ask for `^1`. The reads are SYNCHRONOUS by design:
 * this plugin calls them from `checkCallback(isChecking): boolean`, from settings-row `disabled` predicates,
 * and from loops over vault files — none of which can await.
 *
 * `migrateSettings` is inherited rather than re-declared: it is the generic handover envelope, and taking it
 * from `SettingsMigrationApi` is what gives both ends of that handover one declaration to compile against
 * instead of two copies that drift in silence. What stays declared here is what is genuinely this pair's
 * own — the read-back members below, and the {@link MigratableSettings} payload.
