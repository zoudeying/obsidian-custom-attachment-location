Paste a screenshot into [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and it lands in one shared attachment folder under a name like `Pasted image 20250101120000`. A year later that folder holds a thousand files whose names say nothing about which note they belong to, and moving or renaming a note leaves its attachments behind. This plugin lets you decide **where** each attachment is stored and **what** it is called, from a pattern built out of tokens — `${noteFileName}`, `${date:{momentJsFormat:'YYYYMMDD'}}`, and about twenty more — and then keeps that arrangement true as notes are renamed, moved and deleted. The renaming and deleting half is handled by its companion plugin, [Advanced Rename and Delete Handler](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=advanced-rename-and-delete-handler), which this plugin offers to install for you.

## Demo vault

**The documentation is a demo vault.** Every feature has a note that explains what it does and why you would want it, and walks you through it with a file you supply.

**[Start reading here](<./demo-vault/00 Start.md>)** — it is plain markdown, so it works on GitHub with nothing installed.

A copy of the vault ships with every release. You can access it via any of the following:

1. Running the **Custom Attachment Location: Open demo vault** command.
2. Downloading `obsidian-custom-attachment-location-demo-vault.zip` from the [Releases](https://github.com/mnaoumov/obsidian-custom-attachment-location/releases). It unzips into a single `obsidian-custom-attachment-location-demo-vault-<version>` folder.
3. Browsing its source in [`demo-vault/`](./demo-vault/README.md) in this repository.

## What it does

- **Choose the folder** each new attachment goes into, per note or per anything else a pattern can express — one folder beside every note, a folder per note, a folder per year. [01 Attachment folder location](<./demo-vault/01 Attachment folder location.md>)
- **Choose the file name**, so an attachment is called something that says where it came from instead of `Pasted image 20250101120000`. [02 Attachment file naming](<./demo-vault/02 Attachment file naming.md>)
- **Patterns and tokens** — the vocabulary both of those are written in, including asking you for a value at paste time, reading one from the note's frontmatter, and defining your own tokens in JavaScript. [03 Tokens and patterns](<./demo-vault/03 Tokens and patterns.md>) · [04 Custom tokens](<./demo-vault/04 Custom tokens.md>) · [09 Token reference](<./demo-vault/09 Token reference.md>)
- **Catch attachments other plugins create** — some plugins write an attachment into the vault under a name of their own instead of asking Obsidian where it belongs. Set `renameAttachmentsCreatedByOtherPluginsMode` and those files are moved and renamed too, just after they appear — for every plugin, or only for the ones you name, or for every plugin except the ones you name. Off by default. [06 Settings](<./demo-vault/06 Settings.md>)
- **Collect attachments** — take the attachments a note already has and move them into the folder your settings say they belong in, for one note, one folder, or the whole vault. [05 Collect attachments](<./demo-vault/05 Collect attachments.md>)
- **Delete unused attachments** — move an attachment no note references any more to the trash, after a confirmation dialog. A folder you have designated as one attachment is judged whole: it goes only when nothing outside it references anything inside it, and otherwise stays intact. Set `orphanAttachmentScanMode` and the whole-vault sweep also reaches attachment folders whose note has been deleted, which nothing leads to any more. Off by default. [08 Delete unused attachments](<./demo-vault/08 Delete unused attachments.md>)
- **Keep it true over time** — attachments follow their note when it is renamed or moved, and can be deleted with it. Since 12.0.0 that half is done by [Advanced Rename and Delete Handler](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=advanced-rename-and-delete-handler), which this plugin suggests installing and hands its old settings to; two plugins handling one rename corrupt links and move attachments twice, so exactly one owns it. [06 Settings](<./demo-vault/06 Settings.md>)
- **Link display text** — give an inserted attachment link the attachment's own name as its text, which plugins that render captions can then use. [07 Link display text](<./demo-vault/07 Link display text.md>)
- **Jump between a note and its attachments** — reveal the folder a note's attachments are saved into, and go from an attachment back to the note that owns it. [10 Navigation](<./demo-vault/10 Navigation.md>)

## Tokens

Moved to [09 Token reference](<./demo-vault/09 Token reference.md>) — every token, its format schema and worked examples. For what a pattern is and the tokens most people use, start at [03 Tokens and patterns](<./demo-vault/03 Tokens and patterns.md>).

This heading stays so that the **See available tokens** links inside the plugin's own settings tab keep resolving, including from versions already installed.

### Custom tokens

Moved to [04 Custom tokens](<./demo-vault/04 Custom tokens.md>).

### Markdown URL format

Moved to [06 Settings](<./demo-vault/06 Settings.md>), under `markdownUrlFormat`.
